	Automatically created /trunk directory. We recommend you to put all your
	code there

	* Initial import. Things currently working:
		* Inter server communications between a central server and remote
		servers.
		* Loading of Item.wz, Map.wz, Mob.wz, Reactor.wz, Skill.wz, and
		String.wz data files in KVJ format. MCDB support soon to come with XML
		and WZ support planned in the long run.
		* Game, login, and shop servers can listen and decode packets received
		from MapleStory clients, but do not process anything yet. There has been
		a little headway in login server packet handling.
		* A code stub for a telnet acceptor on the center server. It accepts
		connections but there are many things that need to be done before I can
		even think about implementing commands on it.
	Some more work has to be done on the actual client and server communications
	frameworks, but once that is done, I will start working on implementing
	packet handlers in the login server first. A lot of low level code was taken
	from OdinMS-derived sources in order to speed up development. Thanks guys!

	* Added AGPLv3 license headers to all Java source files.

2011-01-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 4)

	* Removed "argonms.*.data.dir" for all client listening servers because it
	is no longer used (Please specify the data directory with the System
	property "argonms.data.dir")
	* Added MCDB loading for maps data. Item data is soon to come followed by
	the rest.
	* Added error checking for KVJ loaders. When a piece of data doesn't exist,
	the entry in the caches will be null and the load methods will no longer
	throw FileNotFoundExceptions.
	* String data now has to be preloaded on any server that uses it.
	* Every data cache object now has a protected access modifier for all of
	their mutator methods and for their constructor, while only their accessor
	methods have public access. This way, the dynamically loaded data containing
	these static cache objects cannot modify them for the other dynamic data
	that use the same cache.

	* Finished MCDB data loader for items.
	* Merged WzDatabaseConnection into DatabaseConnection.
	* Refactored DatabaseConnection to be more efficient I suppose?

2011-01-25  GoldenKevin  (revision 6)

	* Added MCDB data loading for strings.
	* Please note that a new version of KVJ compiler is released. Please
	recompile all KVJ files!
	* I think I forgot all about how ThreadLocal worked when I created those
	MCDB data loading classes... anyway, the getWzConnection() is called at each
	method call now instead of being stored as a single instance variable for
	all threads.
	* Made constructors of all data loaders to protected and added
	(instance == null) check for every setInstance method just so nobody
	"accidentally" creates more than one instance of those singleton classes. I
	don't mistake you guys as idiots, it's just a safe programming practice.
	* Added MCDB loading for mobs and skills and enabled loading for strings
	(a whoops from the last revision).
	* All data loaders have an canLoad() method now to check if the data for an
	object exists (all except for String apparently). Note that this is not an
	exists() method, i.e. MCDB skills will return true even if the skill does
	not exist as long as there are other skills with the same 3 digit prefix. It
	only determines whether a piece of data can be loaded.
	* In Skill data loader, the player skill operations are now separated from
	those of mob skills, as they rightfully should be.
	* I'm really getting ahead of myself by adding a MapFactory instance
	variable in argonms.game.WorldChannel.

2011-01-29  GoldenKevin  (revision 7)

	* Made some progress on the Telnet listener. Now special telnet chars
	( > 0x7F) are handled properly and won't be in the ASCII string. Just a few
	more tweaks to the way some ASCII chars are handled and it will be ready...
	* Fixed NullPointerException in SkillDataLoader.
	* Fixed MCDB loading of mobs and skills.
	* Added classes for inventory (items, equips, pets, rings, etc.) and moved
	Player class from argonms.game to argonms.character.
	* Support for KvjCompiler r14. Changes include Character.wz compiling and
	reduced size of Mob files.
	* Character.wz is now processed in KvjItemDataLoader. Taming Mob IDs are now
	read in McdbItemDataLoader as well. In McdbItemDataLoader, equips can now be
	made tradeBlocked.
