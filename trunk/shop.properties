# true = Use NIO (new IO) for non-blocking socket operations
# false = use old blocking IO for asynchronous socket operations
# Don't touch this if you don't know what you're doing.
# NIO should scale better for a large amount of players and uses a lot less
# threads than OIO.
# OIO should have higher throughput for smaller amount of players but will use
# more memory.
